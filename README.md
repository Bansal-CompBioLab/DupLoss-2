# DupLoss-2

## **Description**
DupLoss-2 is a program for phylogenomic species tree inference using gene tree parsimony. It takes as input a collection of gene trees and seeks a species tree that best reconciles the input gene trees under a gene duplication and loss reconciliation model. DupLoss-2 can lead to significant improvements in species tree reconstruction accuracy compared to other existing methods on phylogenomic datasets where gene duplication and loss are the primary drivers of gene family evolution. DupLoss-2 is scalable to whole-genome datasets with thousands of gene trees from hundreds of taxa. Further methodological details and experimental results appear in the paper cited below.
